I did several tests, and it became a small but cute app I decided to put in store.</p><p><a href="https://j.mp/bsmup" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-510 size-full" src="http://blog.betimdrenica.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/android_download1.png" alt="" width="129" height="45" /></a><a href="https://j.mp/aplsmup" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-508 size-full" src="http://blog.betimdrenica.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ios_download.png" alt="ios_download" width="135" height="40" /></a></p><p><!--more-->App starts with a simple screen with message that you can't do simple math under pressure.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-515 size-medium" src="http://blog.betimdrenica.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/smup-welcome.png?w=180" alt="smup-welcome" width="180" height="300" /></p><p>And touching a button it starts magical display of numbers with two possible answer you have to decide within seconds.</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-513 size-medium" src="http://blog.betimdrenica.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/smup-game.png?w=180" alt="smup-game" width="180" height="300" /></p><p>If you can't manage to answer in time or touch the wrong answer you simply loose the game, seeing result if your record is broken achieving more stages (spending more time in game answering right results).</p><p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-514 size-medium" src="http://blog.betimdrenica.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/smup-result.png?w=180" alt="smup-result" width="180" height="300" /></p><p>Game has gained a lot of traction at very beginning of the its life and I am very happy for this fact. I hope it will be used by people to start the day, getting up their brain with simple math because it worths.</p><p>So, get the app, give it a try and stick to it untilÂ you beat your last record.</p>
