I published an update for my application <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/apps/da94664d-30f1-4b63-b471-dcbdc3a695e0" target="_blank">Contacts Factbook</a>. This is not a major update but it brings some significant changes. From this version I also started with ads, and this is more a test I'd like see how it will perform, than other reason (btw I wouldn't refuse cents or dollars :D , if it brings any) .

<a href="http://blog.betimdrenica.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/screeshot5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-269" title="Screeshot5" src="http://blog.betimdrenica.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/screeshot5.png?w=180" alt="" width="180" height="300" /></a>

These are new features:

<ul>
	<li>Sharing total number of contacts</li>
	<li>Sharing number of pinned contacts</li>
	<li>Percentage of phone number types</li>
	<li>Pinned contacts</li>
</ul>
